# Bom de bico

## Website to create products from ingredients, calculate price and profit


## Things still missing
- When add a new product, show the total sum of their ingredients by quantity (individual quantity of the ingredient on the product).
- make the ingredients in a way that they have to match the BatchInKg, just saves if is the same
- Make 'report' to print all the products with their ingredients. (wihtout values, just recepys)
- make other types of reports
- Edit sell prices of Products in any place.
- Button to archive the product
- Page for admin where we can delete any content.
- Put suspense on or around the components.
