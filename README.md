# Bom de bico

## Website to create products from ingredients, calculate price and profit


## Things still missing
- When add a new product, show the ingredients and the total sum of their ingredients by quantidade (individual quantity of the ingredient on the product). THen show the medium cost.
- Add column - BatchInKG on product because some products have a smaller batch.
- make the ingredients in a way that they have to match the BatchInKg, just saves if is the same
- Make 'report' to print all the products with their ingredients. (wihtout values, just recepys)
- make other types of reports
